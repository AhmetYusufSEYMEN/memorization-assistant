## Memorization Assistant
It is now very simple to memorize words, even sentences. Visualize and listen to everything you want to memorize as a list, thanks to my rote friend application. Thus, make the information permanent by using both your auditory and visual memory. Also, the app listens to you. It helps you in the best way by telling you your right and wrong. Although not required, I added some features to try myself. In addition, whether the device is Nexus S or Pixel 3, there are no deviations on the screen.
